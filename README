LIBTOMCRYPT RSA DIGITAL SIGNATURES HOW-TO

This how-to describes how to implement RSA digital signatures using
LibTomCrypt (and LibTomMath) on Windows.

GETTING STARTED

1. Get LibTomMath and LibTomCrypt

   git clone -b master https://github.com/libtom/libtommath.git
   git clone -b master https://github.com/libtom/libtomcrypt.git

2. Patch LibTomCrypt

   git apply patches\0001-der-fixes-and-additions.patch
   git apply patches\0002-dsa-fix-compiler-warning.patch
   git apply patches\0003-ecc-fix-compiler-warnings.patch

3. Remove unused source files (optional)

   remove_unsued.pl --force

4. Build LibTomMath and LibTomCrypt

   nmake -f makefile.msvc

5. Generate public/private key pair

   nmake -f makefile.msvc key

6. Run sign and verify examples

   nmake -f makefile.msvc test

7. Have fun!

FILES IN THIS DISTRIBUTION

dertoh.cpp       - Utility to convert from DER to C/C++ header file format,
                   so you can directly include the public key in a C/C++
                   source file.
dertopem.sh      - Bash script that uses OpenSSL to convert the public and
                   private key pair from DER to PEM file format.
error.h          - Helper routines for rsa_make_key.cpp, rsa_sign.cpp, and
                   rsa_verify.cpp.
LICENSE          - License, duh!
makefile.msvc    - Microsoft C/C++ makefile.

README           - <-- You are here.
remove_unused.pl - Perl script that removes all unsued LibTomMath and
                   LibTomCrypt files.
rsa_make_key.cpp - Example that generates a public and private key pair.
rsa_sign.cpp     - Example that signs a message.
rsa_verify.cpp   - Example that verifies a signature.
